Three C programs are provided:

potential.c : Contains functions that calculates the energy, forces, and 
              virial using an embedded atom model (EAM) potential for aluminum.


lattice.c   : Contains a function that generates the positions of atoms in a 
              fcc lattice.

run.c       : You should write your MD program in this file.
	      This makes it possible to test 100% of your code.
	      Since you can't have two main functions in one program.


tools.c     : Add your library from C4 here (and the corresponding header file
	      under include).

The instruction on how to use the functions in lattice.c and potential.c is
in the corresponding header files.
